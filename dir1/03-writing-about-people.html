<div class="main">
<h2 id="writing-about-people">Writing About People</h2>

<p>We write the same way we build apps: with a person-first perspective. Whether you’re writing for an internal or external audience, it's important to write for and about other people in a way that’s compassionate, inclusive, and respectful. Being aware of the impact of your language will help make MailChimp a better place to work and a better steward of our values in the world. In this section we'll lay out some guidelines for writing about people with compassion, and share some resources for further learning.</p>

<h3 id="age">Age</h3>

<p>Don’t reference a person’s age unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If it <em>is</em> relevant, include the person’s specific age, offset by commas.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The CEO, 16, just got her driver’s license.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like “young,” “old,” or “elderly.”</p>

<h3 id="disability">Disability</h3>

<p>Don’t refer to a person’s disability unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. If you need to mention it, use language that emphasizes the person first: ”she has a disability” rather than “she is disabled.”</p>

<p>When writing about a person with disabilities, don’t use the words “suffer,” “victim,” or “handicapped.” “Handicapped parking” is OK.</p>

<h3 id="gender-and-sexuality">Gender and sexuality</h3>

<p>Don’t call groups of people “guys.” Don’t call women “girls.”</p>

<p>Avoid gendered terms in favor of neutral alternatives, like “server” instead of “waitress” and “businessperson” instead of “businessman.”</p>

<p>It’s OK to use “they” as a singular pronoun.</p>

<p>Use the following words as modifiers, but never as nouns:</p>

<ul>
  <li>lesbian</li>
  <li>gay</li>
  <li>bisexual</li>
  <li>transgender (never "transgendered")</li>
  <li>trans</li>
  <li>queer</li>
  <li>LGBT</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t use these words in reference to LGBT people or communities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>homosexual</li>
  <li>lifestyle</li>
  <li>preference</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t use “same-sex” marriage, unless the distinction is relevant to what you’re writing. (Avoid “gay marriage.”) Otherwise, it’s just “marriage.”</p>

<p>When writing about a person, use their communicated pronouns. When in doubt, just ask or use their name.</p>

<h3 id="hearing">Hearing</h3>

<p>Use “deaf” as an adjective to describe a person with significant hearing loss. You can also use “partially deaf” or “hard of hearing.”</p>

<h3 id="heritage-and-nationality">Heritage and nationality</h3>

<p>Don't use hyphens when referring to someone with dual heritage or nationality. For example, use "Asian American" instead of "Asian-American."</p>

<h3 id="medical-conditions">Medical conditions</h3>

<p>Don’t refer to a person’s medical condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing.</p>

<p>If a reference to a person’s medical condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities and emphasize the person first. Don’t call a person with a medical condition a “victim.”</p>

<h3 id="mental-and-cognitive-conditions">Mental and cognitive conditions</h3>

<p>Don’t refer to a person’s mental or cognitive condition unless it’s relevant to what you’re writing. Never assume that someone has a medical, mental, or cognitive condition.</p>

<p>Don’t describe a person as “mentally ill.” If a reference to a person’s mental or cognitive condition is warranted, use the same rules as writing about people with physical disabilities or medical conditions and emphasize the person first.</p>

<h3 id="vision">Vision</h3>

<p>Use the adjective “blind” to describe a person who is unable to see. Use “low vision” to describe a person with limited vision.</p>
